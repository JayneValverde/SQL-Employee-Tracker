## Resources : 

**ASK BCS**: <br>
Again, this week I opened alot of tickets and asked for lots of help from BCS. I would not have gotten this code to where it is without them. Hopped on a few zoom calls and they fixed a lot of syntax problems I kept running into. 

**MODULE 12 assignments**: <br>
I leaned heavily and taking code from assignments we went through in class.
